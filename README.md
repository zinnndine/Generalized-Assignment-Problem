# Generalized-Assignment-Problem
A python/C++ project that uses  variants of heuristic methods  to solve the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) 

## Description

This project is a C++ implementation of heuristic methods for solving the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) — an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem where a set of tasks must be assigned to agents under capacity constraints, while minimizing the total cost.

**Status:** Work in Progress – Not yet complete
