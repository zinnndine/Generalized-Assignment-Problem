# Generalized Assignment Problem

# Generalized Assignment Problem – Heuristic Solver with GUI

A heuristic-based solver for the **Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)** with a Qt C++ graphical interface and Python-based heuristic engine.

---

## Problem Statement

The Generalized Assignment Problem consists of assigning tasks to agents while respecting capacity constraints and minimizing total cost.  
It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in scheduling, logistics, and resource allocation.

---

## Architecture

- The GUI is implemented in **C++ using Qt Creator**
- Optimization heuristics are implemented in **Python** for rapid prototyping
- Clear separation between interface and algorithmic logic

---

## Heuristics Implemented
- Greedy assignment heuristics
- Capacity-aware heuristics
- Zero-based heuristic
- priority-based heuristic

---

## Implementation Details

- GUI: **Qt (C++)**
- Algorithms: **Python**

---

## How to Run

1. Launch the Qt application
2. Input instance data
3. Run selected heuristic
4. View assignment and total cost
